# Introduction

The design of Craigslist is simple and the layout is not complicated. It is easy to navigate around to different sections on the page as well as easy to change to, nearby location, or province wise, or country wise. When loaded the eyes of the user is focused to the center of the screen where all the variety of categories are available. By default it show the name of the city on the top bar, from which the web app is being accessed. As being not too much multimedia intensive it loads in a fair amount of time while using slow internet.

# Target Audience

- Craigslist provides a platform for buyers who wants to purchase and seller who wants to sell a product.
- The seller post the listing of there product, where they can write description about product, title, price, and many more details related to the specific category.
- To post a listing the web app uses a step by step approach, it asks seller to select type of posting, category of posting, form to enter details, area selection on map, upload image.
- Buyers can filter the products by the price, or map, search for specific make and models if the buyer is looking under computer section.
- The buyer may contact the seller by the way the seller have mentioned in their post, maybe by email or by phone or text.

# Overall Design
- The look and feel does not attract a user, because there are not many images or combination of colours used throughout the web app.
- The overall design consist of only single colour which is blue, however it is quite readable on the white background.
- The design is responsive so the layout design changes, from going from bigger screen to smaller screen.

# UI/UX
- The overall experience
- The white spaces and readability is good enough for the users on smaller screen. On larger screen the sub-categories under categories could have some more padding to decrease wrong clicking on the links.
- The small screen design is much more focused on categories, which draws the eyes of user. It mimics the feel of a side drawer on the android phone.
- It is very easy to locate adding post, because it is on the top just next to account section.
- As there are not many multimedia such as images, on home page the web app loads pretty quickly.
- The UI is not consistent on all the screen, some screen follows similar layout and some does not.

# Conclusion
After evaluating the Craigslist, the web app provides neutral experience, because users would like to see different colors / combination of colors, different layout patterns, variety of icons. The one thing that I liked about Craiglist is the way it approaches to allow the user to add new posting in a step by step manner. Every category when visited it shows 61 posts available, however it is not possible to have 61 posts for multiple categories. If it would be me, I would make changes to the web app by arrranging the layout to show information covering the full screen on desktop, and would make categories list as dropdown so the user can quickly navigate. I would also add beautiful attractive colors.
